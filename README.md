# Convolutional-Neural-Network-From-Scratch


THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN PROCESS

## TO DO
- BACKPROPAGATION ON CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS
- CLEAN THE CODE
- IMPROVE PERFORMANCE
- IMPLEMENT DROPOUT LAYERS

## WHY (MOTIVATION)
I want to know how CNN works before use Tensorflow or another kind of library, so there is not a lot documentation of Machine learning for C#. 

## HOW TO USE
Just Download it and open as project

## This program uses 
1. [Simple Linear Algebra for C#](https://github.com/HectorPulido/Simple_Linear_Algebra)
2. [FRUIT IMAGES DATASET](https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset)

## Where can i learn more
- On my Youtube channel (spanish) are a lot of information about Machine learning and Neural networks
- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_iMeH0P0nsIDPvBaJckOw
- You can also look at the generalized Example of This 
- https://github.com/HectorPulido/Vectorized-multilayer-neural-network
- Or The monolayer Example (Simpler)
- https://github.com/HectorPulido/Simple-vectorized-mono-layer-perceptron
- Or Look at a Non Vectorized multilayer perceptronExample
